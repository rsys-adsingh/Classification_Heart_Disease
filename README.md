# Classification_Heart_Disease
Heart disease prediction based on medical measurements  Samples: 303 patients 

1. Features: 
This dataset includes a subset of 14 attributes out of the original 76 in the database:

ID: A unique identifier for each patient.
Age: The age of the patient in years.
Origin: The geographic location or source of the study.
Sex: Gender of the patient (Male/Female).
Chest Pain Type (CP): Categorized as typical angina, atypical angina, non-anginal pain, or asymptomatic.
Resting Blood Pressure (Trestbps): Measured in mm Hg at the time of hospital admission.
Cholesterol (Chol): Serum cholesterol levels in mg/dL.
Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS): Indicates whether fasting blood sugar is >120 mg/dL (True/False).
Resting Electrocardiographic Results (Restecg): Includes normal results, ST-T abnormalities, and left ventricular hypertrophy.
Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (Thalach): A critical marker of cardiovascular performance.
Exercise-Induced Angina (Exang): Presence or absence of exercise-induced angina (True/False).
Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, a measure of ischemia.
Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment: Indicates the incline or decline pattern during peak exercise.
Number of Major Vessels (CA): Fluoroscopic visualization of 0 to 3 major vessels.
Thalassemia (Thal): Categories include normal, fixed defect, and reversible defect.

2. Target Variable
Num: The primary predictive attribute, indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.14 features (age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, etc.) Classes: 2 (presence/absence of heart disease)
